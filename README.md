# Vue To Do App

## Project Aims
1. Build a simple app using Vue

## Developer Aims
1. Learn the basic fundamentals of the Vue framework

## Process
* Node.js and Vue were installed using CLI and VSCode
    * https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/vuejs-tutorial
    * https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac?origin_team=T0L30B202
* Tutorial was followed (see Credits)
* Comments added to the code to explain process used in the tutorial

## Future Plans
1. [ ] Add further comments to make the code more useful as a learning reference for the Developer and others
2. [ ] Go beyond the tutorial - use vue to add further components which manipulate the data.
3. [ ] Refactor and customise the css to make the app more visually appealing
